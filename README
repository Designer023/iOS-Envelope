To use simply import the class
#import "envelope.h"

Then add it as a subview so it appears above everything else. This can be done in the viewDidLoad method

- (void)viewDidLoad
{
    [super viewDidLoad];
  
    envelope *Env = [[envelope alloc] initWithFrame: self.view.frame
                                           topFrame: CGRectMake(0, 0, 320, 290)
                                        bottomFrame: CGRectMake(0, 53, 320, 427)
                                           topImage:@"loading-upper.png" 
                                        bottomImage:@"loading-base.png"];
    [self.view addSubview:Env];

}


Specify the images and the dimensions of the frame. Currently the animation is hardcoded to the dimentions above!

-dynamic animations need to be added
-sounds need to be added
-callbacks need to be added
